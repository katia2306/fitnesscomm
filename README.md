This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How To Install

```sh
npm install
npm install -g source-map-explorer npm-check-updates
```

## Install VSCode Recommended Extensions

> See `.vscode/extensions.json` to check for recommended extensions.

If **material-icon-theme** extension is installed then add this configuration to **VSCode User Settings**. This is because the extension does not feature **Workspace Settings** yet.

```json
"material-icon-theme.activeIconPack": "react_redux",
"material-icon-theme.folders.associations": {
  "forms": "messages",
  "sagas": "redux-actions",
  "reducer": "redux-reducer"
},
"material-icon-theme.files.associations": {
  "package.json": "npm",
  "package-lock.json": "npm",
  "*.saga.ts": "redux-action",
  "*.model.ts": "typescript-def"
}
```
